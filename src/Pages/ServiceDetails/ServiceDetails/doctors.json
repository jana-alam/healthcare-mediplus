General media and TV have a big part to play for this. If you searched the word ‘plastic surgery’ in Google today, first few thousand images will be of beautiful celebrities’ cosmetic procedures and their complications thereof. So, it is of no big surprise that general public, policy makers and many doctors are unaware of the origin and scope of plastic surgery. Plastic surgery has its roots firmly based in reconstructive surgery, and any qualified plastic surgeon has to go through the rigorous training in all aspects of plastic surgery including aesthetic surgery, which is a part of plastic surgery as a whole.","imageUrl":"https://i.ibb.co/VD632WD/usman-yousaf-p-Trhfmj2j-DA-unsplash.jpg"}]
